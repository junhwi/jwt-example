\section{Introduction}

The rise of single page applications (SPAs) and demand for multiplatform compatibility lead us to decouple the front-end from the back-end in system architecture. This trend made Token based authentication become popular recently\cite{authentication}. Following is main advantages of token for authentication:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item	Stateless and scalable servers
\item	Mobile application ready
\item	Pass authentication to other applications
\item	Security
\end{itemize}

We can easily find token based authentication from anywhere. Applications like Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and other services from big companies are using token based authentication.

\subsection{The Conventional Method}
Before we examine how token based authentication works and its benefits, we need to look at the traditional way of authentication.
The HTTP protocol is stateless, this means that if we authenticate to application with a username and password, the application wonâ€™t remeber who we are on the next request. Therefore, we would have to authenticate again for each request. The traditional way of having our applications remember who we are is to store the user logged in information on the server. This can be done in a few different ways on the session, usually in memory or stored on the disk\cite{authorization}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/traditional}
\caption{This is a figure to explain traditional method. (\textbf{a}) User enters their login credentials. (\textbf{b})Server verifies the credentials are correct and creates a session which is then stored in a database. (\textbf{c}) A cookie with the session ID is placed in the users browser. (\textbf{d}) On subsequent requests, the session ID is verified against the database and if valid the request processed. (\textbf{e}) Once a user logs out of the app, the session is destroyed both client and server side.}
\label{traditional}
\end{figure}

Here is a graph of how a server based authentication workflow would look(Figure~\ref{traditional}). As the web, applications, and the rise of the mobile application have come about, this method of authentication has shown problems\cite{authentication-mobile, attacks}.
The problems with server based authentication are as follows.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item	Sessions : Every time a user is authenticated, the server will need to create a record somewhere on our server. This is usually done in memory and when there are many users authenticating, the overhead on your server increases.
\item	Scalability : Since sessions are stored in memory, this provides problems with scalability. As our cloud providers start replicating servers to handle application load, having vital information in session memory will limit our ability to scale.
\item	CORS : As we want to expand our application to let our data be used across multiple mobile devices, we have to worry about cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). When using AJAX calls to grab resources from another domain (mobile to our API server), we could run into problems with forbidden requests.
\item	CSRF : We will also have protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Users are susceptible to CSRF attacks since they can already be authenticated with say a banking site and this could be taken advantage of when visiting other sites.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Token Based Method}
Token based authentication is stateless. We are not storing any information about our user on the server or in a session. This concept alone takes care of many of the problems with having to store information on the server\cite{one-time-cookies}.
No session information means your application can scale and add more machines as necessary without worrying about where a user is logged in.
Although this implementation can vary, the gist of it is as follows.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item User requests access with Username / Password
\item Application validates credentials
\item Application provides a signed token to the client
\item Client stores that token and sends it along with every request
\item Server verifies token and responds with data
\end{itemize}

Every single request will require the token. This token should be sent in the HTTP header so that we keep with the idea of stateless HTTP requests. We will also need to set our server to accept requests from all domains using Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *. Whatâ€™s interesting about designating * in the ACAO header is that it does not allow requests to supply credentials like HTTP authentication, client-side SSL certificates, or cookies.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/tokenbased}
\caption{This is a figure to explain token based method. (\textbf{a}) User enters their login credentials. (\textbf{b}) Server verifies the credentials are correct and returns a signed token. (\textbf{c}) This token is stored client-side, most commonly in local storage - but can be stored in session storage or a cookie as well. (\textbf{d}) Subsequent requests to the server include this token as an additional Authorization header or through one of the other methods mentioned above. (\textbf{e}) The server decodes the token and if the token is valid processes the request. (\textbf{f}) Once a user logs out, the token is destroyed client-side, no interaction with the server is necessary.}
\label{tokenbased}
\end{figure}

Hereâ€™s an graph to explain the process(Figure~\ref{tokenbased}). Once we have authenticated with our information and we have our token, we are able to do many things with this token\cite{token-based-fast}.

We could even create a permission based token and pass this along to a third-party application (say a new mobile app we want to use\cite{token-based-mobile}), and they will be able to have access to our data â€” but only the information that we allowed with that specific token.

\subsection{The Benefits of Token Based Method}
Tokens stored on client side. Completely stateless, and ready to be scaled. Our load balancers are able to pass a user along to any of our servers since there is no state or session information anywhere. If we were to keep session information on a user that was logged in, this would require us to keep sending that user to the same server that they logged in at. Because it brings problems, some users would be forced to the same server and this could bring about a spot of heavy traffic. Those problems are gone with tokens since the token itself holds the data for that user.

The token, not a cookie, is sent on every request and since there is no cookie being sent, this helps to prevent CSRF attacks. Even if your specific implementation stores the token within a cookie on the client side, the cookie is merely a storage mechanism instead of an authentication one. There is no session based information to manipulate since we donâ€™t have a session. The token also expires after a set amount of time, so a user will be required to login once again. This helps us stay secure. There is also the concept of token revocation that allows us to invalidate a specific token and even a group of tokens based on the same authorization grant\cite{evaluating-authentication}.

Tokens will allow us to build applications that share permissions with another. For example, we have linked random social accounts to our major ones like Facebook or Twitter. When we login to Twitter through a service (letâ€™s say Buffer), we are allowing Buffer to post to our Twitter stream. By using tokens, this is how we provide selective permissions to third-party applications. We could even build our own API and hand out special permission tokens if our users wanted to give access to their data to another application.

We talked a bit about CORS earlier. When our application and service expands, we will need to be providing access to all sorts of devices and applications. Having our API just serve data, we can also make the design choice to serve assets from a CDN. This eliminates the issues that CORS brings up after we set a quick header configuration for our application. Our data and resources are available to requests from any domain now as long as a user has a valid token.

When creating the token, you have a few options. Weâ€™ll be diving more into this topic when we secure an API in a follow-up article, but the standard to use would be JSON Web Tokens. This handy debugger and library chart shows the support for JSON Web Tokens. You can see that it has a great amount of support across a variety of languages. This means you could actually switch out your authentication mechanism if you choose to do so in the future.

\subsection{JWT}
JSON Web Token, or JWT in short is the new token format which JSON style claims are encoded into base64. It has a compact claims representation to be used in space-constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers. It is an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

JWT consists of 3 parts, JOSE header, JWT claim set and JWS signature. JOSE header describes the type of the token and signing algorithm of the token. JWT claim set is where the data we want to claim is stored. The data in JWT claim set is stored in JSON format. JWS signature is where the message authentication code(MAC) of base64 encoded JOSE header and JWT claim set signed with a secret key is stored. When JOSE header, JWT claim set and JWS signature is prepared, the sequence of base64 encoded value of each parts separated by period forms JWT. Figure ~\ref{structure} shows the structure of the JWT.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/jwt_structure}
    \caption{Structure of JWT}
    \label{structure}
\end{figure}

The signature is verified to check the validity of the JWT. When the token is transmitted, the token validation module calculate the MAC code of base64 encoded JOSE header and JWT claim set with secret key stored in server. The token is valid if and only if the calculated MAC code matches the transmitted token's JWS signature. When we need to seperate the token publisher and verifier, the secret key can be replaced with the public key and private key by applying asymmetric signing algorithm to token. The common symmetric JWT signature is HMAC using SHA-256 called HS256. RSA and ECSDA with SHA-256 are commonly used as an asymmetric signing algorithm.

\subsection{Vulnerability of JWT}

Tim McLean had reported vulnerabilities of JWT that comes from implementation fault at Auth0 blogs\footnote{https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/}. First vulnerability is that token with none signing algorithm bypasses the authenticator's validation process. Since anyone can change the JWT's JOSE header, the attacker is able to forge the token's signing algorithm to none. When attacker makes forged token, token by itself satisfies the JWT format but the token is not what authenticator expected. In order to block this vulnerability, the validation method should check if the token's signing algorithm is expected or not. However in 5 official JWT libraries, the token with none signing algorithm could bypass the validation.

Second vulnerability is changing the token's signing algorithm from asymmetric to symmetric. In asymmetric signed JWT, public key is used for validation, and private key is used for making the token. When server publish the token with asymmetric signing algorithm, it opens the token and its public key. When the attacker have a token and its public key, he/she can modify the token claim. Then he alter the signing algorithm to symmetric and sign a token with a public key. The forged token by itself has proper JWT format, but this should not be accepted to server.

We examined 6 official JWT libraries if they had those vulnerabilities, and their patch to vulnerabilites. We chose the most popular JWT libraries of the often used programming language. Chosen languages are PHP, Node.js, Python, C, Go, and Java. The most popular libraries of the languages are php-jwt\footnote{https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt}, node-jsonwebtoken\footnote{https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken}, pyjwt\footnote{https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/}, libjwt\footnote{https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt}, jwt-go\footnote{https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go}, and java-jwt\footnote{https://github.com/auth0/java-jwt}. Table~\ref{libraries} shows if they had these vulnerabilities and how many days are required to patch them. In the table, O mark represents there were vulnerabilities. Among 6 libraries, 2 of them were vulnerable to none signing and 3 of them were vulnerable to altering asymmetric to symmetric signing algorithm. Php-jwt were vulnerable to both issues. Node-jsonwebtoken and pyjwt only had altering signing algorithm vulnerability. Jwt-go and java-jwt was free from both vulnerabilities. Libjwt had none signing vulnerability. Second vulnerability of libjwt is marked bar because it does not support any asymmetric signing algorithm.

            Java & java-jwt & X & X & -
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Examined Libraries}
    \label{libraries}
\end{table}

To block the none singing vulnerabilities, php-jwt library let server to set the expected algorithm. when the input token's signing algorithm is defer from the expected token, the token is invalid. For C, libjwt algorithm simply blocks the all none signed token. For the altering asymmetric signing to symmetric vulnerability, pyjwt set the restriction on HMAC key. If the key as public key format or x509 certificate format, then the key cannot be used as HMAC key. In Node-jsonwebtoken library, when the input token's signing key has public key format, they restrict the token to be validated only by asymmetric algorithm. Finally for the php-jwt, the patch from none signing vulnerability also patches this issue.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Potential Vulnerabilities}
We categorized vulnerabilities of JWT into 3 category.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item Modifiable JOSE header
\item Bruteforce attack
\item Replay attack
\end{itemize}

Since JOSE header is not encrypted, anyone can modify the JOSE header of the JWT which holds the token type and signing algorithm. The two known vulnerabilities were possible because of this modifiable JOSE header design of JWT.


\subsubsection{Brute Force Attack}

The important point is JWT is not encrypted and it is just encoded in base64. Therefore, using its signature and other parts, you can do brute force attack to exploit the secret key used for JWS signature. Since JWT already contains everything we need to attack, it can be exploited without any communication with server. This means, server doesn't have control over the brute force attack. The dangerous point is secret key is not changed frequently and shared in system wide. Therefore, if you success to find the secret key even with long time, then you can generate fake token as many times as you want. To prove our idea, we conducted simple bruteforce attack with short secret data and its hashed value. The verification of the token can be done in local without any limitation, and without any communication with server. It is perfect environment for brute force attack.

Figure~\ref{bruteforce} shows the structure of the token we want to attack. To prove our idea, we did small experiment using John the Ripper\footnote{https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper} which is free password cracker. When performed on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine, with an Intel Core i7 3.4GHz processor and 16GB memory, the attack takes approximately 3 hours and 44 minutes. This confirms we can find the secret at a very low cost.

This experiment shows that brute force attack is really feasible when weak secret key are used. Obviously, long and complex key will make system secure but the point is JWT itself don't have a way to control it. Someone can argue to change the secret periodically, but it will make massive invalidation of issued token and spoil the usability of application.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/bruteforce}
\caption{Simple JWT to demonstrate brute force attack.}
\label{bruteforce}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Replay Attack}

In web enviroment there always exists the threat of cross site scripting(XSS) and JWT can be stolen by attacker if it succeeds. Traditional cookie-based authentication provides a http-only option to prevent XSS attack but in token based authentication we don't have method to control it. Stolen token can be reused by attacker who can pretend like normal user and make malicious request. That is token based authentication is vulnerable to replay attack.

As we pointed, the key characteristic of token based authentication is server doesn't have control over issued token. The only way to control token is setting short expiration period but it results it degrades usability of service. 

The widely known solution to replay attack for JWT based authentication is to use jti claim in JWT. The jti is a reserved claim of JWT and it sotres a unique identifier of a JWT. For example, nounce can be used for jti. If jti is used, server have to memory the unique identifier of issued token and this leads to a stateful architecutre. Whenever server gets token with jti field, server can check the identifier and prohibit the reuse of the token. Figure~\ref{nounce_issue} and Figure~\ref{nounce_use} shows example sequence of using JWT with nounce in jti field.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/nounce_issue}
\caption{Issue JWT with nounce}
\label{nounce_issue}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/nounce_use}
\caption{Block replay attack using nounce}
\label{nounce_use}
\end{figure}

Although, jti can be the shield of JWT against replay attack, it will lose the advantage of stateless architecture. Also, making the server stateful is not much different with traditional session method and it's reinventing the wheel. In this point of view, using JWT in stateful way can be even more risky than traditional session because of its immaturity of implementation.
Therefore, we can say there is no reason and advantage to use stateful JWT as an authentication session.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Proper Usage of JWT}
We recommand to use JWT for one-time authentication between multiple entities in service. One of example is SDK services. In case of SDK services, SDK provider needs to verify the client is authenticated user of service which is using SDK service. Then, client get a signed claim from its service and bring it to SDK provider. If the cryptographic proof, signature, is valid, SDK provider can trust the client and allow to use functions. JWT can be used for this signed claim to prove authentication of client between multiple services.

Another example is stateless micro-service architecture. With the rise of cloud services, many companies are using an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), such as Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud Platform and build many small statless components on top of it. For example, if you run stateless file server in your service, authentication server can issue a short-period ticket to download file for authenticated user. Since it has short expiration and is used only once, JWT can be used without weakness that we mentioned above.
% Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

\section{Conclusions}
Many examples in web is suggesting use JWT to manage persistent session between server and client. However, it's even worse compared to traditional cookie based session management. As stated in RFC proposal, proper usage of JWT is claiming someone is authenticated from another service in cryptographic reliable way. SDK service or stateless micro service arhitecture is one of example of this kind of usage.
%This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.

%\section{}
%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathemtaical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

%\section{}
%All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
